One metric to rule them all? A global assessment of the importance of shape complexity for the environmental heterogeneity of protected areas

Abstract: 
Protected areas (PAs) are often designed as single, large, and compact patches, with area as a fundamental attribute. While the importance of area is strongly supported by the species-area relationship, much less is known about other geometric attributes. For instance, PAs composed of multiple, dispersed, non-circular patches could encompass a broader range of habitats. From a spatial-geometry perspective, in addition to location and size, shape is a fundamental property that could be adjusted to enhance nature protection.

Here, we evaluated how the geometric attributes of PAs—specifically, area, shape (e.g., compactness and fractal dimension), fragmentation (polygon count), and northerness alignment — and their interactions — affect environmental heterogeneity, a key proxy for biodiversity. We analyzed 108,957 terrestrial PAs from the World Database of Protected Areas using Random Forest, with heterogeneity quantified through the coefficient of variation of NDVI and elevation, and the Shannon index of diversity and number of classes representing diversity of climate and land cover.

This work will be presented at the TIBS2026 conference in Aarhus.
